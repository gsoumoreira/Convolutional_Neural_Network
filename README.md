# Convolutional_Neural_Network

Convolutional Neural Network implementation and discussion following the [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning) course

## Introduction

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) topics have been grown rapidly in recent years. One of the reasons is the high potential in computer vision area. **Image Classification**, **Object Detection**, **Neural Style Transfer** are examples of hot-topics nowadays that receive high investiment from big companies.

## Challenges

One of the challenges of computer vision problem is the intput, where process images is usually expensive. Thinking in a simple neural network, process a image requires a large number of parameters and might result in overfitting.
